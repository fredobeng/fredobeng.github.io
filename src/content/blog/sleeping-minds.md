From my bunker, everyone appears asleep,
But do they know?
The house that was meant to keep us awake
Fed us dreamcakes,
And delighted in feeding us, forgetting its cause.
  
I've heard of houses elsewhere,
And I've learned they're much different from ours:
Everyone's kept awake,
And everyone's kept excited.
Hallways are filled, and bunkers are empty.
  
Awakening and excitement are what grow us,
Such is our nature.
And yet, and yet,
When will I see change?
When will we be awakened from our slumber?
