I told myself I would start a blog some time ago, and I'm excited to be starting now. I will be sharing my thoughts and experiences, as well as anything interesting I discover and find worthy to share. But why start a blog? There are a few reasons why I'm embarking on this new journey, and I will be sharing them in this post.

I am starting this blog to improve my thinking and expressive abilities. I have read and heard many scholars emphasize the importance of writing for thinking. I believe that working on this blog regularly will make me more thoughtful and also help improve my use of the English language.

Another reason I am starting this blog is to learn more. Like many, I have a lot of interests. Writing publicly about the things I'm interested in and care about offers an opportunity to learn more about them. I hope to also discover new interests along the way.

I'm also doing this to improve my web-development skills. I learn some concepts in web development every now and then, and working on this blog is one of the ways I intend to practice what I learn. That said, don't be surprised if you see changes in the design of the site the next time you visit.

One other reason why I'm starting this blog is to express myself more. I find myself wanting to say a lot of things everyday but keep most of them to myself. I think having a space where I can be myself and say what I have in mind will be really helpful for me.

The above reasons are all true, but I think the truest of my reasons for starting this blog is simply the desire to create something—to start something and see what comes of it. Let's see how it all turns out.
