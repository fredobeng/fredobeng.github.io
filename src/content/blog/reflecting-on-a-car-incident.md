An event last week caught my attention. While attempting to cross the road, another man and I encountered a car that appeared to be making a three-point turn. After enough reverse-forward motions to drive off in the opposite direction, the driver reversed again. The man beside me grew furious and complained, shouting something that translates to "it's okay, it's okay!" I heard him, but I don't think the driver did. I observed as the driver moved forward again. It turned out his goal was to park with the car's rear facing the initial direction, requiring that extra reverse-forward motion. I smiled after he finished and thought, "interesting."
  
This happening is not the first of its kind. There have been previous instances where I've noticed myself and others make comments or take actions because of what we thought some other was about, only to realise later we were mistaken.
  
I suppose we should learn a few things from such experiences. 
  
Virtues that struck me as I reflected on the incident were patience, tolerance, and open-mindedness. We mustn't jump to conclusions hastily; we should bear with others; and we should be open to outcomes that may not align with our expectations. We might be surprised by what we find.
